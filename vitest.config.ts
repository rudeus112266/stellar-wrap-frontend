// Single runner for the unit and integration suites (issue #595).
// Jest previously handled `test:unit` while Vitest handled `test:integration`
// and `test:hooks`; the split was accidental, so everything now runs under
// Vitest. This config covers the node environment (unit + integration);
// component tests keep their own jsdom config in vitest.hooks.config.ts.
//
// The hooks suite is kept separate because it needs a jsdom environment
// (React component rendering) plus its own setup file, which the node-based
// integration setup does not provide. That is a genuine environment need, so
// the split is intentional rather than accidental.
